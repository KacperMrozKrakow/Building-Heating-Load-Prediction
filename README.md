## Overview
This project aims to predict the heating load and energy consumption of buildings by analyzing their structural parameters, such as wall area, roof area, and overall height. By testing multiple regression models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost, the project seeks to determine the most accurate algorithm for forecasting energy usage in energy-efficient buildings.

The primary focus is on leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize energy consumption based on building characteristics. This allows for the exploration of how different models handle numerical data in the context of building automation, where efficiency is crucial. The models are compared based on their prediction accuracy and performance, with the goal of identifying the best approach for minimizing energy waste and improving energy management in smart buildings.

By testing a variety of machine learning algorithms, this project provides insights into how advanced data-driven techniques can be applied to real-world energy management problems, paving the way for their integration into intelligent building control systems.

# Results
The project compares various regression models in predicting building energy consumption and concludes which model is most effective. Key visualizations include:

Energy consumption prediction results:

A comparison between actual and predicted heating load values: This plot compares the actual heating load values of buildings with the predicted values generated by the machine learning models. The closer the predicted values are to the actual values, the better the model’s accuracy.

Why It’s Useful: This comparison allows us to visually assess the performance of different regression models. It helps demonstrate how well the models are able to predict energy usage based on building characteristics, and highlights any significant deviations or inaccuracies.

Standard deviation chart between predicted and actual values: This chart shows the standard deviation between the predicted and actual heating load values for the different regression models. It illustrates the spread of errors, providing a quantitative measure of model accuracy.

Why It’s Useful: The standard deviation between predicted and actual values gives insight into the consistency and reliability of the model. A lower standard deviation indicates that the model is making more precise predictions, while a higher value may suggest the model struggles with certain data points.
